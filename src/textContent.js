    title: "About the graph",
    content: `This Graph provides on a monthly basis, the global mean surface temperature anomaly from 1880.04 to the present (in celsius).
      Air temperatures on Earth have been rising since the Industrial Revolution. While natural variability plays some part, the preponderance of evidence indicates that human activities—particularly emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases—are mostly responsible for making our planet warmer.
      According to an ongoing temperature analysis led by scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), the average global temperature on Earth has increased by at least 1.1° Celsius (1.9° Fahrenheit) since 1880. The majority of the warming has occurred since 1975, at a rate of roughly 0.15 to 0.20°C per decade.
      Why should we care about one or two degrees of global warming? After all, temperatures fluctuate by many degrees every day where we live.
      The temperatures we experience locally and in short periods can fluctuate significantly due to predictable, cyclical events (night and day, summer and winter) and hard-to-predict wind and precipitation patterns. But the global temperature mainly depends on how much energy the planet receives from the Sun and how much it radiates back into space. The energy coming from the Sun fluctuates very little by year, while the amount of energy radiated by Earth is closely tied to the chemical composition of the atmosphere—particularly the amount of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.
      A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all of the oceans, the atmosphere, and the land masses by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age. A five-degree drop was enough to bury a large part of North America under a towering mass of ice 20,000 years ago.`,

    title: "About the graph",
    content: `This Graph provides on a monthly basis, the amount of methane in the atmosphere from 1983 to the present. Expressed as a mole fraction in dry air, parts per million (ppm).
       The concentration of methane in the atmosphere is currently around two-and-a-half times greater than its pre-industrial levels. The increase has accelerated in recent years, and preliminary analysis indicates 2021’s rise is likely to be amongst the largest ever recorded.
       Methane is responsible for around 30% of the rise in global temperatures since the industrial revolution, and rapid and sustained reductions in methane emissions are key to limit near-term warming and improve air quality.
       Two key characteristics determine the impact of different greenhouse gases on the climate: the length of time they remain in the atmosphere and their ability to absorb energy. Methane has a much shorter atmospheric lifetime than carbon dioxide (CO2) - around 12 years compared with centuries - but absorbs much more energy while it exists in the atmosphere.`,

  carbonDioxide: {
    title: "About the graph",
    content: `This Graph provides on a monthly basis, the amount of CarbonDioxide in the atmosphere from 1983 to the present. Expressed as a mole fraction in dry air, parts per million (ppm).
      Based on analysis from NOAA’s Global Monitoring Lab, global average atmospheric carbon dioxide was 414.72 parts per million (“ppm” for short) in 2021, setting a new record high despite the continued economic drag from the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, the jump of 2.58 ppm over 2021 amounts tied for 5th-highest annual increase in NOAA's 63-year record.
      Carbon dioxide concentrations are rising mostly because of the fossil fuels that people are burning for energy. Fossil fuels like coal and oil contain carbon that plants pulled out of the atmosphere through photosynthesis over many millions of years.
      Carbon dioxide is Earth’s most important greenhouse gas: a gas that absorbs and radiates heat. Unlike oxygen or nitrogen (which make up most of our atmosphere), greenhouse gases absorb heat radiating from the Earth’s surface and re-release it in all directions—including back toward Earth’s surface. Without carbon dioxide, Earth’s natural greenhouse effect would be too weak to keep the average global surface temperature above freezing. By adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, people are supercharging the natural greenhouse effect, causing global temperature to rise`,

    title: "About the graph",
    content: `This Graph provides on a monthly basis, the amount of nitrous oxide in the atmosphere from 2001 to the present. Expressed as a mole fraction in dry air, parts per million (ppm).
      Nitrous oxide, also known as “laughing gas,” is the most important greenhouse gas after methane and carbon dioxide and the biggest human-related threat to the ozone layer.
      It enhances the greenhouse effect just as carbon dioxide does by capturing reradiated infrared radiation from the Earth's surface and subsequently warming the troposphere (lower atmosphere)`,

  arctic: {
    title: "About the graph",
    content: `This API provides the average monthly arctic sea ice extent each September since 1979, derived from satellite observations.
      Polar ice caps are melting as global warming causes climate change. We lose Arctic sea ice at a rate of almost 13% per decade, and over the past 30 years, the oldest and thickest ice in the Arctic has declined by a stunning 95%.
      If emissions continue to rise unchecked, the Arctic could be ice-free in the summer by 2040. But what happens in the Arctic does not stay in the Arctic. Sea ice loss has far-reaching effects around the world.
      There are going to be impacts on global temperatures, Coastal communities, Food supply chains, Shipping and the Global Wildlife!`,
